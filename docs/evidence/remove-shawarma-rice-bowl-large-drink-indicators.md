# Menu Update: Remove Shawarma Rice Bowl & Remove "Large" Indicator in Drinks

Branch: `t3/remove-shawarma-large-drink-labels`

## Summary

This update completes two menu changes:
1. **Remove Shawarma Rice Bowl**: Retired the standalone ₱50 Shawarma Rice Bowl from all ordering surfaces and documentation (kiosk, storefront price boards, Schema.org metadata, AI directory, and product documentation). The distinct Sulit Meal (`S3 – Shawarma Rice` at ₱99 with egg, siomai, ham, rice, and drink) remains available as intended.
2. **Remove "Large" Indicator on All Drinks**: Removed the `promoLabel: 'LARGE'` badge that was stamped across all 30 drink menu items in the kiosk app (Coolers, Lemon Series, Soda Pop, Oreo Craze, Milo Craze, Cream Float Craze). Drink cards now render clean, unobstructed food photography. Buy 1 Take 1 fruit sodas now cleanly show their `BUY 1 TAKE 1` badge rather than being overridden by the "LARGE" banner.
